# Vision Text Recognition Image

This is my implementation of the [Text Recognition](https://youtu.be/dnbFa9SyDLA) tutorial by Afraz Siddiqui at [iOS Academy](https://iosacademy.io/) (Thanks Afraz!).

This project uses Swift, UIKit, and Vision.

## What I learned 

How to: 

Perform a VNRecognizeTextRequest to recognize text in a still image and return the request results in a VNRecognizeTextObservation object

Get text results from the VNRecognizeTextObservation object and display the text to the user in a UILabel
